## Jukebox App

An app to colaboratively listen to music. like the good old days when we had the Real jukebox playing records qued by people.

# Why we need this?

Well it was a monday afternoon and a colleague of mine was playing songs through a bluetooth speaker, I pinged him to play a song I really liked, turned out a lot of people I work with really liked the song. its a nice feeling to play a song you like to your firends and colleagues. but I was not the only one who was pestering him to play my song. many others were doing the same. soon we strted to annoy the nice guy playing the songs.

Hmm, if only there was a way to play songs from a realtime playlist qued up up real people who are listen to the songs.

well there is no way of doing that currently, trust I looked all over the web. so took it upon my self to create a Web app to do the same.
